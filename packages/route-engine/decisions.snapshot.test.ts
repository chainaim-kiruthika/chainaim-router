/**
 * Decision-snapshot regression net.
 *
 * The other test files assert properties; this one pins outcomes. It routes a
 * fixed corpus — 22 prompts spanning every task type the classifier can emit,
 * crossed with 4 profiles and a rotation of tool/vision/structured-output
 * shapes — against frozen pricing and a frozen clock, and compares the
 * complete decisions against decisions.snapshot.json.
 *
 * Two kinds of change hit this file, and they should feel different:
 *
 *  - A refactor must leave the snapshot byte-identical. If this test fails on
 *    a change you believed was behavior-preserving, it was not.
 *  - A deliberate routing change (config tweak, scoring change, model EOL)
 *    must regenerate the snapshot: `UPDATE_DECISION_SNAPSHOT=1 npx vitest run
 *    decisions.snapshot.test.ts`. The resulting JSON diff in review is the
 *    change's decision-level footprint — reviewers see which requests moved,
 *    not just which weights did.
 *
 * Full decisions are pinned deliberately — reasoning strings included, since
 * hosts and the Python port assert on their wording. Costs are deterministic
 * because pricing and `now` are frozen. The one omission is `tierConfigs`:
 * it echoes the config for every row, so pinning it would turn any one-tier
 * config edit into an 88-row diff, and the selected chain is already pinned
 * through `candidates`.
